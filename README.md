This is a planned e-learning platform for healthcare professionals. The idea was sparked from [a paramedic students' final project][1], which recognizes possible demand for an ECG interpretation learning tool.

Then again, why limit to only ECGs? The platform could also be used for dynamic patient cases, in which user choices affect the outcome. Also, the usefulness of game-like features could be explored.

The platform should be suitable for learning activities from simple quizzes all the way to patient cases in emergency medicine, anaesthesia monitoring exercises, ECG rhythm recognition and 12-channel interpretation drills. The features mentioned here are just brainstormed ideas. Actual first stage focus will be defined later.

This project is in the spirit of [FOAMed - Free Open Access Medical Education][2]. Thus, the licensing model should be such that any educational content published on this platform should be accessible to everyone. Perhaps the revenue logic could be similar to open source software.
